# DolphinMoveSDK

The MOVE SDK enables you to collect location data, motion information and other sensor data from your users’ smartphones. This data is then transmitted to our backend, where it is evaluated, enriched with industry leading machine learning algorithms and applied to a comprehensive 24/7 timeline. 
This timeline gives you insights on where your users move and how they get there, be it in the past, the present or even the future (via our prediction algorithms). 
With our MOVE SDK, you will gain a deep understanding of your users’ personas and service them in a whole new way, completely transforming the way you interact with them.
