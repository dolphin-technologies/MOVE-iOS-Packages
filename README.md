# DolphinMoveSDK

The MOVE SDK enables you to collect location data, motion information and other sensor data from your usersâ€™ smartphones. This data is then transmitted to our backend, where it is evaluated, enriched with industry leading machine learning algorithms and applied to a comprehensive 24/7 timeline. 
This timeline gives you insights on where your users move and how they get there, be it in the past, the present or even the future (via our prediction algorithms).

This repository contains the **MOVE SDK for iOS**, which can be used by the **Swift Package Manager** (https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). You can add the MOVE SDK to your Swift app with a dependency link to this repository. For more information please refer to https://docs.movesdk.com (https://docs.movesdk.com/move-platform/sdk/getting-started/ios/installation).
